            <h2 class="head">Federico García Lorca</h2>
            <p> Federico García Lorca, (born June 5, 1898, Fuente Vaqueros, Granada province, Spain—died August
                18 or
                19,
                1936, between Víznar and Alfacar, Granada province), Spanish poet and playwright who, in a
                career that
                spanned
                just 19 years,
                resurrected and revitalized the most basic strains of Spanish poetry and theatre. He is known
                primarily
                for his
                Andalusian works,
                including the poetry collections Romancero gitano (1928; Gypsy Ballads) and Llanto por Ignacio
                Sánchez
                Mejías
                (1935; “Lament for Ignacio Sánchez Mejías,” Eng. trans. Lament for a Bullfighter), and the
                tragedies
                Bodas de
                sangre (1933; Blood Wedding),
                Yerma (1934; Eng. trans. Yerma), and La casa de Bernarda Alba (1936; The House of Bernarda
                Alba). In the
                early
                1930s Lorca helped inaugurate
                a second Golden Age of the Spanish theatre. He was executed by a Nationalist firing squad in the
                first
                months of
                the Spanish Civil War.
            </p>

            <p>Lorca was at work on Aurelia and Bernarda Alba in the summer of 1936 when the Spanish Civil War
                broke
                out.
                On August 16, he was arrested in Granada by Nationalist forces, who abhorred his homosexuality
                and his
                liberal
                views,
                and imprisoned without a trial. On the night of August 18 or 19 (the precise date has never been
                verified), he
                was driven to a remote hillside
                outside town and shot. In 1986 the Spanish government marked the 50th anniversary of Lorca’s
                death by
                erecting a
                monument on the site of his murder.
                The gesture bears witness to Lorca’s stature as the most important Spanish poet and playwright
                of the
                20th
                century, a man whose work continues to
                influence writers and artists throughout the world and to speak to readers everywhere of all
                that is
                most
                central to the human condition.</p>
